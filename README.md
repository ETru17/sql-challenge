First step was to create a ERD ising QuickDBD.
![screenshot_of_ERD](https://github.com/ETru17/sql-challenge/blob/main/SQL_Challenge_ERD.png)

Then I exported the file to run in PGAdmin to create my tables.
I did have to edit a few times due to mislabled "types"

I then imported the csv files in order, starting with "Employees" DB

From there I referenced the in class activities and chatGPT, for  de-bugging syntax, to complete the assignment.
